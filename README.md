# randomHackerName

This was more or less a fun way to give a hacker name

First version was mainly a stupid simple random answer

Second version I wanted to give it more flare as if you logged into a site and you got thrown into the hacking world.

Third version is still in the works as I'm still looking for something cooler to add to it, kinda like falling rain 
the matrix or something like that.
